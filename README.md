# Country based gender file
The JSON file is the data basis of the free webservice www.namesia.de, which allows you to discover the gender of a first name in a simple, RESTful way. The JSON file itself is based on the awesome *nam_dict.txt* file, created by Jörg Michael. This file was included in a software package distributed by the german it magazine *c't*.
